Subject: [PATCH] Smack: Handle io_uring kernel thread privileges
Patch-mainline: v5.10.4
References: openEuler-21.03

stable inclusion
from stable-5.10.4
commit 8f939abd8119564c1df3d9d16534879796f063c1
bugzilla: 46903

--------------------------------

[ Upstream commit 942cb357ae7d9249088e3687ee6a00ed2745a0c7 ]

Smack assumes that kernel threads are privileged for smackfs
operations. This was necessary because the credential of the
kernel thread was not related to a user operation. With io_uring
the credential does reflect a user's rights and can be used.
