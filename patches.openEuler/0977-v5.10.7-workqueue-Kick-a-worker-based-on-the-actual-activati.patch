Subject: [PATCH] workqueue: Kick a worker based on the actual activation of
 delayed works
Patch-mainline: v5.10.7
References: openEuler-21.03

stable inclusion
from stable-5.10.7
commit dfec7dc891d7f1c336c16b3198c950fcd31607bc
bugzilla: 47429

--------------------------------

[ Upstream commit 01341fbd0d8d4e717fc1231cdffe00343088ce0b ]

In realtime scenario, We do not want to have interference on the
isolated cpu cores. but when invoking alloc_workqueue() for percpu wq
on the housekeeping cpu, it kick a kworker on the isolated cpu.

  alloc_workqueue
    pwq_adjust_max_active
      wake_up_worker

The comment in pwq_adjust_max_active() said:
  "Need to kick a worker after thawed or an unbound wq's
   max_active is bumped"

So it is unnecessary to kick a kworker for percpu's wq when invoking
alloc_workqueue(). this patch only kick a worker based on the actual
activation of delayed works.
