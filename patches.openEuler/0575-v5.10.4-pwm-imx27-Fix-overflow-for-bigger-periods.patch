bugzilla: 46903

--------------------------------

[ Upstream commit 1ce65396e6b2386b4fd54f87beff0647a772e1cd ]

The second parameter of do_div is an u32 and NSEC_PER_SEC * prescale
overflows this for bigger periods. Assuming the usual pwm input clk rate
of 66 MHz this happens starting at requested period > 606060 ns.

Splitting the division into two operations doesn't loose any precision.
It doesn't need to be feared that c / NSEC_PER_SEC doesn't fit into the
unsigned long variable "duty_cycles" because in this case the assignment
above to period_cycles would already have been overflowing as
period >= duty_cycle and then the calculation is moot anyhow.
