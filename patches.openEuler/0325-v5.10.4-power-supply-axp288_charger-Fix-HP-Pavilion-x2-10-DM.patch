--------------------------------

[ Upstream commit a0f1ccd96c7049377d892a4299b6d5e47ec9179d ]

Commit 9c80662a74cd ("power: supply: axp288_charger: Add special handling
for HP Pavilion x2 10") added special handling for HP Pavilion x2 10
models which use the weird combination of a Type-C connector and the
non Type-C aware AXP288 PMIC.

This special handling was activated by a DMI match a the product-name
of "HP Pavilion x2 Detachable". Recently I've learned that there are
also older "HP Pavilion x2 Detachable" models with an AXP288 PMIC +
a micro-usb connector where we should not activate the special handling
for the Type-C connectors.

Extend the matching to also match on the DMI board-name and match on the
2 boards (one Bay Trail based one Cherry Trail based) of which we are
certain that they use the AXP288 + Type-C connector combination.

Note the DSDT code from these older (AXP288 + micro-USB) models contains
some AML code (which never runs under Linux) which reads the micro-USB
connector id-pin and if it is pulled to ground, which would normally mean
the port is in host mode!, then it sets the input-current-limit to 3A,
it seems HP is using the micro-USB port as a charging only connector
and identifies their own 3A capable charger though this hack which is a
major violation of the USB specs. Note HP also hardcodes a 2A limit
when the id-pin is not pulled to ground, which is also in violation
of the specs.

I've no intention to add support for HP's hack to support 3A charging
on these older models. By making the DMI matches for the Type-C equipped
models workaround more tighter, these older models will be treated just
like any other AXP288 + micro-USB equipped device and the input-current
limit will follow the BC 1.2 spec (using the defacto standard values
there where the BC 1.2 spec defines a range).
