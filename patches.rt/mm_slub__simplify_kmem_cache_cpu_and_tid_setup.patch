Subject: mm, slub: simplify kmem_cache_cpu and tid setup

From: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>

In slab_alloc_node() and do_slab_free() fastpaths we need to guarantee that
our kmem_cache_cpu pointer is from the same cpu as the tid value. Currently
that's done by reading the tid first using this_cpu_read(), then the
kmem_cache_cpu pointer and verifying we read the same tid using the pointer and
plain READ_ONCE().

This can be simplified to just fetching kmem_cache_cpu pointer and then reading
tid using the pointer. That guarantees they are from the same cpu. We don't
need to read the tid using this_cpu_read() because the value will be validated
by this_cpu_cmpxchg_double(), making sure we are on the correct cpu and the
freelist didn't change by anyone preempting us since reading the tid.
