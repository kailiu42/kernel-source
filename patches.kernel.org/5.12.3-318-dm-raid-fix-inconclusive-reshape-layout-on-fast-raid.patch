Subject: [PATCH] dm raid: fix inconclusive reshape layout on fast raid4/5/6
 table reload sequences
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

commit f99a8e4373eeacb279bc9696937a55adbff7a28a upstream.

If fast table reloads occur during an ongoing reshape of raid4/5/6
devices the target may race reading a superblock vs the the MD resync
thread; causing an inconclusive reshape state to be read in its
constructor.

lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-reshape-stripes-load-reload.sh can cause
BUG_ON() to trigger in md_run(), e.g.:
"kernel BUG at drivers/md/raid5.c:7567!".

Scenario triggering the bug:

1. the MD sync thread calls end_reshape() from raid5_sync_request()
   when done reshaping. However end_reshape() _only_ updates the
   reshape position to MaxSector keeping the changed layout
   configuration though (i.e. any delta disks, chunk sector or RAID
   algorithm changes). That inconclusive configuration is stored in
   the superblock.

2. dm-raid constructs a mapping, loading named inconsistent superblock
   as of step 1 before step 3 is able to finish resetting the reshape
   state completely, and calls md_run() which leads to mentioned bug
   in raid5.c.

3. the MD RAID personality's finish_reshape() is called; which resets
   the reshape information on chunk sectors, delta disks, etc. This
   explains why the bug is rarely seen on multi-core machines, as MD's
   finish_reshape() superblock update races with the dm-raid
   constructor's superblock load in step 2.

Fix identifies inconclusive superblock content in the dm-raid
constructor and resets it before calling md_run(), factoring out
identifying checks into rs_is_layout_change() to share in existing
rs_reshape_requested() and new rs_reset_inclonclusive_reshape(). Also
enhance a comment and remove an empty line.
