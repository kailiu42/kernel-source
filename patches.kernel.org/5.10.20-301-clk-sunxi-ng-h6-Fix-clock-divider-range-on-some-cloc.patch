Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: h6: Fix clock divider range on some clocks
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 04ef679591c76571a9e7d5ca48316cc86fa0ef12 ]

While comparing clocks between the H6 and H616, some of the M factor
ranges were found to be wrong: the manual says they are only covering
two bits [1:0], but our code had "5" in the number-of-bits field.

By writing 0xff into that register in U-Boot and via FEL, it could be
confirmed that bits [4:2] are indeed masked off, so the manual is right.

Change to number of bits in the affected clock's description.
