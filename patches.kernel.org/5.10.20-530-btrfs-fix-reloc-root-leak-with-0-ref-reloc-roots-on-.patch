Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix reloc root leak with 0 ref reloc roots on recovery
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

commit c78a10aebb275c38d0cfccae129a803fe622e305 upstream.

When recovering a relocation, if we run into a reloc root that has 0
refs we simply add it to the reloc_control->reloc_roots list, and then
clean it up later.  The problem with this is __del_reloc_root() doesn't
do anything if the root isn't in the radix tree, which in this case it
won't be because we never call __add_reloc_root() on the reloc_root.

This exit condition simply isn't correct really.  During normal
operation we can remove ourselves from the rb tree and then we're meant
to clean up later at merge_reloc_roots() time, and this happens
correctly.  During recovery we're depending on free_reloc_roots() to
drop our references, but we're short-circuiting.

Fix this by continuing to check if we're on the list and dropping
ourselves from the reloc_control root list and dropping our reference
appropriately.  Change the corresponding BUG_ON() to an ASSERT() that
does the correct thing if we aren't in the rb tree.
