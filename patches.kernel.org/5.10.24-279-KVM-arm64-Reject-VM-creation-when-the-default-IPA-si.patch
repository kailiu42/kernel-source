Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Reject VM creation when the default IPA size is
 unsupported
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit 7d717558dd5ef10d28866750d5c24ff892ea3778 upstream.

KVM/arm64 has forever used a 40bit default IPA space, partially
due to its 32bit heritage (where the only choice is 40bit).

However, there are implementations in the wild that have a *cough*
much smaller *cough* IPA space, which leads to a misprogramming of
VTCR_EL2, and a guest that is stuck on its first memory access
if userspace dares to ask for the default IPA setting (which most
VMMs do).

Instead, blundly reject the creation of such VM, as we can't
satisfy the requirements from userspace (with a one-off warning).
Also clarify the boot warning, and document that the VM creation
will fail when an unsupported IPA size is provided.

Although this is an ABI change, it doesn't really change much
for userspace:

- the guest couldn't run before this change, but no error was
  returned. At least userspace knows what is happening.

- a memory slot that was accepted because it did fit the default
  IPA space now doesn't even get a chance to be registered.

The other thing that is left doing is to convince userspace to
actually use the IPA space setting instead of relying on the
antiquated default.
