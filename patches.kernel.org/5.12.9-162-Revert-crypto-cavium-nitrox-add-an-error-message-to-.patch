Subject: [PATCH] Revert "crypto: cavium/nitrox - add an error message to
 explain the failure of pci_request_mem_regions"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

[ Upstream commit 6a3239a738d86c5e9b5aad17fefe2c2bfd6ced83 ]

This reverts commit 9fcddaf2e28d779cb946d23838ba6d50f299aa80 as it was
submitted under a fake name and we can not knowingly accept anonymous
contributions to the repository.

This commit was part of a submission "test" to the Linux kernel
community by some "researchers" at umn.edu.  As outlined at:
	https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ekjlu/papers/full-disclosure.pdf
it was done so as an attempt to submit a known-buggy patch to see if it
could get by our review.  However, the submission turned out to actually
be correct, and not have a bug in it as the author did not understand
how the PCI driver model works at all, and so the submission was
accepted.

As this change is of useless consequence, there is no loss of
functionality in reverting it.
