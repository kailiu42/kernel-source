Subject: [PATCH] Revert "video: hgafb: fix potential NULL pointer dereference"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.7

commit 58c0cc2d90f1e37c4eb63ae7f164c83830833f78 upstream.

This reverts commit ec7f6aad57ad29e4e66cc2e18e1e1599ddb02542.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

This patch "looks" correct, but the driver keeps on running and will
fail horribly right afterward if this error condition ever trips.

So points for trying to resolve an issue, but a huge NEGATIVE value for
providing a "fake" fix for the problem as nothing actually got resolved
at all.  I'll go fix this up properly...
