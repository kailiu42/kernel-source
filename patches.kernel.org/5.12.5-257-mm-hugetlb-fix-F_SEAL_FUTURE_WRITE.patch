Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: fix F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.5

commit 22247efd822e6d263f3c8bd327f3f769aea9b1d9 upstream.

Patch series "mm/hugetlb: Fix issues on file sealing and fork", v2.

Hugh reported issue with F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE not applied correctly to
hugetlbfs, which I can easily verify using the memfd_test program, which
seems that the program is hardly run with hugetlbfs pages (as by default
shmem).

Meanwhile I found another probably even more severe issue on that hugetlb
fork won't wr-protect child cow pages, so child can potentially write to
parent private pages.  Patch 2 addresses that.

After this series applied, "memfd_test hugetlbfs" should start to pass.

This patch (of 2):

F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE is missing for hugetlb starting from the first day.
There is a test program for that and it fails constantly.

$ ./memfd_test hugetlbfs
memfd-hugetlb: CREATE
memfd-hugetlb: BASIC
memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-WRITE
memfd-hugetlb: SEAL-FUTURE-WRITE
mmap() didn't fail as expected
Aborted (core dumped)

I think it's probably because no one is really running the hugetlbfs test.

Fix it by checking FUTURE_WRITE also in hugetlbfs_file_mmap() as what we
do in shmem_mmap().  Generalize a helper for that.
