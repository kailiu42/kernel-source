Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpufeatures: Force disable X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD and remove
 update_pasid()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.10

commit 9bfecd05833918526cc7357d55e393393440c5fa upstream.

While digesting the XSAVE-related horrors which got introduced with
the supervisor/user split, the recent addition of ENQCMD-related
functionality got on the radar and turned out to be similarly broken.

update_pasid(), which is only required when X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD is
available, is invoked from two places:

 1) From switch_to() for the incoming task

 2) Via a SMP function call from the IOMMU/SMV code

#1 is half-ways correct as it hacks around the brokenness of get_xsave_addr()
   by enforcing the state to be 'present', but all the conditionals in that
   code are completely pointless for that.

   Also the invocation is just useless overhead because at that point
   it's guaranteed that TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is set on the incoming task
   and all of this can be handled at return to user space.

#2 is broken beyond repair. The comment in the code claims that it is safe
   to invoke this in an IPI, but that's just wishful thinking.

   FPU state of a running task is protected by fregs_lock() which is
   nothing else than a local_bh_disable(). As BH-disabled regions run
   usually with interrupts enabled the IPI can hit a code section which
   modifies FPU state and there is absolutely no guarantee that any of the
   assumptions which are made for the IPI case is true.

   Also the IPI is sent to all CPUs in mm_cpumask(mm), but the IPI is
   invoked with a NULL pointer argument, so it can hit a completely
   unrelated task and unconditionally force an update for nothing.
   Worse, it can hit a kernel thread which operates on a user space
   address space and set a random PASID for it.

The offending commit does not cleanly revert, but it's sufficient to
force disable X86_FEATURE_ENQCMD and to remove the broken update_pasid()
code to make this dysfunctional all over the place. Anything more
complex would require more surgery and none of the related functions
outside of the x86 core code are blatantly wrong, so removing those
would be overkill.

As nothing enables the PASID bit in the IA32_XSS MSR yet, which is
required to make this actually work, this cannot result in a regression
except for related out of tree train-wrecks, but they are broken already
today.
