Subject: [PATCH] spi: dw: Avoid stack content exposure
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 386f771aad15dd535f2368b4adc9958c0160edd4 ]

Since "data" is u32, &data is a "u32 *" type, which means pointer math
will move in u32-sized steps. This was meant to be a byte offset, so
cast &data to "char *" to aim the copy into the correct location.

Seen with -Warray-bounds (and found by Coverity):
