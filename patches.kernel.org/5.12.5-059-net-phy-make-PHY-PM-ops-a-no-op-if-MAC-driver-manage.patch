Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: make PHY PM ops a no-op if MAC driver manages PHY
 PM
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.5

[ Upstream commit fba863b816049b03f3fbb07b10ebdcfe5c4141f7 ]

Resume callback of the PHY driver is called after the one for the MAC
driver. The PHY driver resume callback calls phy_init_hw(), and this is
potentially problematic if the MAC driver calls phy_start() in its resume
callback. One issue was reported with the fec driver and a KSZ8081 PHY
which seems to become unstable if a soft reset is triggered during aneg.

The new flag allows MAC drivers to indicate that they take care of
suspending/resuming the PHY. Then the MAC PM callbacks can handle
any dependency between MAC and PHY PM.
