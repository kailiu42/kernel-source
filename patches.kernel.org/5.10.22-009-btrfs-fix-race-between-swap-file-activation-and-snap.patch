Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race between swap file activation and snapshot
 creation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.22

commit dd0734f2a866f9d619d4abf97c3d71bcdee40ea9 upstream.

When creating a snapshot we check if the current number of swap files, in
the root, is non-zero, and if it is, we error out and warn that we can not
create the snapshot because there are active swap files.

However this is racy because when a task started activation of a swap
file, another task might have started already snapshot creation and might
have seen the counter for the number of swap files as zero. This means
that after the swap file is activated we may end up with a snapshot of the
same root successfully created, and therefore when the first write to the
swap file happens it has to fall back into COW mode, which should never
happen for active swap files.

Basically what can happen is:

1) Task A starts snapshot creation and enters ioctl.c:create_snapshot().
   There it sees that root->nr_swapfiles has a value of 0 so it continues;

2) Task B enters btrfs_swap_activate(). It is not aware that another task
   started snapshot creation but it did not finish yet. It increments
   root->nr_swapfiles from 0 to 1;

3) Task B checks that the file meets all requirements to be an active
   swap file - it has NOCOW set, there are no snapshots for the inode's
   root at the moment, no file holes, no reflinked extents, etc;

4) Task B returns success and now the file is an active swap file;

5) Task A commits the transaction to create the snapshot and finishes.
   The swap file's extents are now shared between the original root and
   the snapshot;

6) A write into an extent of the swap file is attempted - there is a
   snapshot of the file's root, so we fall back to COW mode and therefore
   the physical location of the extent changes on disk.

So fix this by taking the snapshot lock during swap file activation before
locking the extent range, as that is the order in which we lock these
during buffered writes.
