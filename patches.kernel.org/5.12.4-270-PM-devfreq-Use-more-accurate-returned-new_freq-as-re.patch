Subject: [PATCH] PM / devfreq: Use more accurate returned new_freq as
 resume_freq
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.4

[ Upstream commit 62453f1ba5d5def9d58e140a50f3f168f028da38 ]

Use the more accurate returned new_freq as resume_freq.
It's the same as how devfreq->previous_freq was updated.
