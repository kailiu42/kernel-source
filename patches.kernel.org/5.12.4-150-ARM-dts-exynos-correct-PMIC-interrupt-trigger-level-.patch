Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: correct PMIC interrupt trigger level on P4
 Note family
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.4

[ Upstream commit fbe9c9bb2e929865500a0985735f81c0142accad ]

The Maxim PMIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.

Additionally, the interrupt line is shared so using level sensitive
interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.
