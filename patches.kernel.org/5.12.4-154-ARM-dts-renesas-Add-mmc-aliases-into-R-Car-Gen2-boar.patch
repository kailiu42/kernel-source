Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: renesas: Add mmc aliases into R-Car Gen2 board dts
 files
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.4

[ Upstream commit da926e813fc7f9f0912fa413981a1f5ba63a536d ]

After set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS flag on the mmc host drivers,
the order of /dev/mmcblkN was not fixed in some SoCs which have
multiple SDHI and/or MMCIF controllers. So, we were hard to use
such a device as rootfs by using the kernel parameter like
"root=/dev/mmcblkNpM".

According to the discussion on a mainling list [1], we can add
mmc aliases to fix the issue. So, add such aliases into R-Car Gen2
board dts files. Note that, since R-Car Gen2 is even more complicated
about SDHI and/or MMCIF channels variations and they share pins,
add the aliases into board dts files instead of SoC dtsi files.
