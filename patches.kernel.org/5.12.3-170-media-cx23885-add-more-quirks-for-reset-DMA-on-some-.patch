Subject: [PATCH] media: cx23885: add more quirks for reset DMA on some AMD
 IOMMU
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

[ Upstream commit 5f864cfbf59bfed2057bd214ce7fbf6ad420d54b ]

The folowing AMD IOMMU are affected by the RiSC engine stall, requiring a
reset to maintain continual operation. After being added to the
broken_dev_id list the systems are functional long term.

0x1481 is the PCI ID for the IOMMU found on Starship/Matisse

0x1419 is the PCI ID for the IOMMU found on 15h (Models 10h-1fh) family

0x5a23 is the PCI ID for the IOMMU found on RD890S/RD990
