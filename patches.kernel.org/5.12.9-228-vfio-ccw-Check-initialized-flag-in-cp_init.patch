Subject: [PATCH] vfio-ccw: Check initialized flag in cp_init()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

[ Upstream commit c6c82e0cd8125d30f2f1b29205c7e1a2f1a6785b ]

We have a really nice flag in the channel_program struct that
indicates if it had been initialized by cp_init(), and use it
as a guard in the other cp accessor routines, but not for a
duplicate call into cp_init(). The possibility of this occurring
is low, because that flow is protected by the private->io_mutex
and FSM CP_PROCESSING state. But then why bother checking it
in (for example) cp_prefetch() then?

Let's just be consistent and check for that in cp_init() too.
