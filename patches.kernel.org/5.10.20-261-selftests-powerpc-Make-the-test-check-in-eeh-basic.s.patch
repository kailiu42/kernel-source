Subject: [PATCH] selftests/powerpc: Make the test check in eeh-basic.sh posix
 compliant
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 3db380570af7052620ace20c29e244938610ca71 ]

The == operand is a bash extension, thus this will fail on Ubuntu
with:
  ./eeh-basic.sh: 89: test: 2: unexpected operator

As the /bin/sh on Ubuntu is pointed to DASH.

Use -eq to fix this posix compatibility issue.
