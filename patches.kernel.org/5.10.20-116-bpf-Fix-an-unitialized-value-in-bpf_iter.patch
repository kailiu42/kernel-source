Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix an unitialized value in bpf_iter
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 17d8beda277a36203585943e70c7909b60775fd5 ]

Commit 15d83c4d7cef ("bpf: Allow loading of a bpf_iter program")
cached btf_id in struct bpf_iter_target_info so later on
if it can be checked cheaply compared to checking registered names.

syzbot found a bug that uninitialized value may occur to
bpf_iter_target_info->btf_id. This is because we allocated
bpf_iter_target_info structure with kmalloc and never initialized
field btf_id afterwards. This uninitialized btf_id is typically
compared to a u32 bpf program func proto btf_id, and the chance
of being equal is extremely slim.

This patch fixed the issue by using kzalloc which will also
prevent future likely instances due to adding new fields.
