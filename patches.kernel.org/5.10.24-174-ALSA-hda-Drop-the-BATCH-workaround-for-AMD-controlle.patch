Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Drop the BATCH workaround for AMD controllers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit 28e96c1693ec1cdc963807611f8b5ad400431e82 upstream.

The commit c02f77d32d2c ("ALSA: hda - Workaround for crackled sound on
AMD controller (1022:1457)") introduced a few workarounds for the
recent AMD HD-audio controller, and one of them is the forced BATCH
PCM mode so that PulseAudio avoids the timer-based scheduling.  This
was thought to cover for some badly working applications, but this
actually worsens for more others.  In total, this wasn't a good idea
to enforce it.

This is a partial revert of the commit above for dropping the PCM
BATCH enforcement part to recover from the regression again.
