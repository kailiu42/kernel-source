Subject: [PATCH] ia64: fix ia64_syscall_get_set_arguments() for break-based
 syscalls
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.27

[ Upstream commit 0ceb1ace4a2778e34a5414e5349712ae4dc41d85 ]

In https://bugs.gentoo.org/769614 Dmitry noticed that
`ptrace(PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO)` does not work for syscalls called via
glibc's syscall() wrapper.

ia64 has two ways to call syscalls from userspace: via `break` and via
`eps` instructions.

The difference is in stack layout:

1. `eps` creates simple stack frame: no locals, in{0..7} == out{0..8}
2. `break` uses userspace stack frame: may be locals (glibc provides
   one), in{0..7} == out{0..8}.

Both work fine in syscall handling cde itself.

But `ptrace(PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO)` uses unwind mechanism to
re-extract syscall arguments but it does not account for locals.

The change always skips locals registers. It should not change `eps`
path as kernel's handler already enforces locals=0 and fixes `break`.

Tested on v5.10 on rx3600 machine (ia64 9040 CPU).
