Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: DJM-750: ensure format is set
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.7

commit e7df7df5a3809d733888db6ce6592a644acaac19 upstream.

Add case statement to set sample-rate for the DJM-750 Pioneer
mixer. This was included as part of another patch but I think it has
been archived on Patchwork and hasn't been merged.
