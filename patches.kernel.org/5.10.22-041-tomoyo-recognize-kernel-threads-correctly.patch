Subject: [PATCH] tomoyo: recognize kernel threads correctly
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.22

commit 9c83465f3245c2faa82ffeb7016f40f02bfaa0ad upstream.

Commit db68ce10c4f0a27c ("new helper: uaccess_kernel()") replaced
segment_eq(get_fs(), KERNEL_DS) with uaccess_kernel(). But the correct
method for tomoyo to check whether current is a kernel thread in order
to assume that kernel threads are privileged for socket operations was
(current->flags & PF_KTHREAD). Now that uaccess_kernel() became 0 on x86,
tomoyo has to fix this problem. Do like commit 942cb357ae7d9249 ("Smack:
Handle io_uring kernel thread privileges") does.
