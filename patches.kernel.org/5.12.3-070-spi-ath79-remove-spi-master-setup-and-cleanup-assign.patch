Subject: [PATCH] spi: ath79: remove spi-master setup and cleanup assignment
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

[ Upstream commit ffb597b2bd3cd78b9bfb68f536743cd46dbb2cc4 ]

This removes the assignment of setup and cleanup functions for the ath79
target. Assigning the setup-method will lead to 'setup_transfer' not
being assigned in spi_bitbang_init. Because of this, performing any
TX/RX operation will lead to a kernel oops.

Also drop the redundant cleanup assignment, as it's also assigned in
spi_bitbang_init.
