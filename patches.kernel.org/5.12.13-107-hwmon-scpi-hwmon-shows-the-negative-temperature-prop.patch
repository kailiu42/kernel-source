Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (scpi-hwmon) shows the negative temperature properly
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.13

[ Upstream commit 78d13552346289bad4a9bf8eabb5eec5e5a321a5 ]

The scpi hwmon shows the sub-zero temperature in an unsigned integer,
which would confuse the users when the machine works in low temperature
environment. This shows the sub-zero temperature in an signed value and
users can get it properly from sensors.
