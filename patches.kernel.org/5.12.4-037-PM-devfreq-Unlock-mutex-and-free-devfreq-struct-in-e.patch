Subject: [PATCH] PM / devfreq: Unlock mutex and free devfreq struct in error
 path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.4

commit 8b50a7995770d41a2e8d9c422cd2882aca0dedd2 upstream.

The devfreq->lock is held for time of setup. Release the lock in the
error path, before jumping to the end of the function.

Change the goto destination which frees the allocated memory.

Cc: v5.9+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v5.9+
Fixes: 4dc3bab8687f ("PM / devfreq: Add support delayed timer for polling mode")
