Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: Increase timeout for HC halt
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.5

commit ca09b1bea63ab83f4cca3a2ae8bc4f597ec28851 upstream.

On some devices (specifically the SC8180x based Surface Pro X with
QCOM04A6) HC halt / xhci_halt() times out during boot. Manually binding
the xhci-hcd driver at some point later does not exhibit this behavior.
To work around this, double XHCI_MAX_HALT_USEC, which also resolves this
issue.
