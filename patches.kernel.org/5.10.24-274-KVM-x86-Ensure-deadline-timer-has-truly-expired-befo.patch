Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Ensure deadline timer has truly expired before
 posting its IRQ
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit beda430177f56656e7980dcce93456ffaa35676b upstream.

When posting a deadline timer interrupt, open code the checks guarding
__kvm_wait_lapic_expire() in order to skip the lapic_timer_int_injected()
check in kvm_wait_lapic_expire().  The injection check will always fail
since the interrupt has not yet be injected.  Moving the call after
injection would also be wrong as that wouldn't actually delay delivery
of the IRQ if it is indeed sent via posted interrupt.
