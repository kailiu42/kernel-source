-Q: How can I tell what patches are queued up for backporting to the various stable releases?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-A: Normally Greg Kroah-Hartman collects stable commits himself, but for
-networking, Dave collects up patches he deems critical for the
-networking subsystem, and then hands them off to Greg.
-
-There is a patchworks queue that you can see here:
-
-  https://patchwork.kernel.org/bundle/netdev/stable/?state=*
-
-It contains the patches which Dave has selected, but not yet handed off
-to Greg.  If Greg already has the patch, then it will be here:
-
-  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/stable-queue.git
-
-A quick way to find whether the patch is in this stable-queue is to
-simply clone the repo, and then git grep the mainline commit ID, e.g.
-::
-
-  stable-queue$ git grep -l 284041ef21fdf2e
-  releases/3.0.84/ipv6-fix-possible-crashes-in-ip6_cork_release.patch
-  releases/3.4.51/ipv6-fix-possible-crashes-in-ip6_cork_release.patch
-  releases/3.9.8/ipv6-fix-possible-crashes-in-ip6_cork_release.patch
-  stable/stable-queue$

-Q: I see a network patch and I think it should be backported to stable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Q: Should I request it via stable@vger.kernel.org like the references in
-the kernel's Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst file say?
-A: No, not for networking.  Check the stable queues as per above first
-to see if it is already queued.  If not, then send a mail to netdev,
-listing the upstream commit ID and why you think it should be a stable
-candidate.
-
-Before you jump to go do the above, do note that the normal stable rules
-in :ref:`Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst <stable_kernel_rules>`
-still apply.  So you need to explicitly indicate why it is a critical
-fix and exactly what users are impacted.  In addition, you need to
-convince yourself that you *really* think it has been overlooked,
-vs. having been considered and rejected.
-
-Generally speaking, the longer it has had a chance to "soak" in
-mainline, the better the odds that it is an OK candidate for stable.  So
-scrambling to request a commit be added the day after it appears should
-be avoided.
-
-Q: I have created a network patch and I think it should be backported to stable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Q: Should I add a Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org like the references in the
-kernel's Documentation/ directory say?
-A: No.  See above answer.  In short, if you think it really belongs in
-stable, then ensure you write a decent commit log that describes who
-gets impacted by the bug fix and how it manifests itself, and when the
-bug was introduced.  If you do that properly, then the commit will get
-handled appropriately and most likely get put in the patchworks stable
-queue if it really warrants it.
-
-If you think there is some valid information relating to it being in
-stable that does *not* belong in the commit log, then use the three dash
-marker line as described in
-:ref:`Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst <the_canonical_patch_format>`
-to temporarily embed that information into the patch that you send.
-
-Q: Are all networking bug fixes backported to all stable releases?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-A: Due to capacity, Dave could only take care of the backports for the
-last two stable releases. For earlier stable releases, each stable
-branch maintainer is supposed to take care of them. If you find any
-patch is missing from an earlier stable branch, please notify
-stable@vger.kernel.org with either a commit ID or a formal patch
-backported, and CC Dave and other relevant networking developers.
+Q: Are there special rules regarding stable submissions on netdev?
+---------------------------------------------------------------
+While it used to be the case that netdev submissions were not supposed
+to carry explicit ``CC: stable@vger.kernel.org`` tags that is no longer
+the case today. Please follow the standard stable rules in
+:ref:`Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst <stable_kernel_rules>`,
+and make sure you include appropriate Fixes tags!
 
 Q: Is the comment style convention different for the networking content?
