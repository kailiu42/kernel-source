Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: Fix race condition in mirror
 installation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit edcbf5137f093b5502f5f6b97cce3cbadbde27aa upstream.

When mirroring to a gretap in hardware the device expects to be
programmed with the egress port and all the encapsulating headers. This
requires the driver to resolve the path the packet will take in the
software data path and program the device accordingly.

If the path cannot be resolved (in this case because of an unresolved
neighbor), then mirror installation fails until the path is resolved.
This results in a race that causes the test to sometimes fail.

Fix this by setting the neighbor's state to permanent, so that it is
always valid.
