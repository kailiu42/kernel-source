Subject: [PATCH] i2c: qcom-geni: Add shutdown callback for i2c
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.10

[ Upstream commit 9f78c607600ce4f2a952560de26534715236f612 ]

If the hardware is still accessing memory after SMMU translation
is disabled (as part of smmu shutdown callback), then the
IOVAs (I/O virtual address) which it was using will go on the bus
as the physical addresses which will result in unknown crashes
like NoC/interconnect errors.

So, implement shutdown callback for i2c driver to suspend the bus
during system "reboot" or "shutdown".

Fixes: 37692de5d523 ("i2c: i2c-qcom-geni: Add bus driver for the Qualcomm GENI I2C controller")
