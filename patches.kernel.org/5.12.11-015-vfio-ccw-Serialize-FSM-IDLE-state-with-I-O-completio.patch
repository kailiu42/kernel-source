Subject: [PATCH] vfio-ccw: Serialize FSM IDLE state with I/O completion
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.11

[ Upstream commit 2af7a834a435460d546f0cf0a8b8e4d259f1d910 ]

Today, the stacked call to vfio_ccw_sch_io_todo() does three things:

  1) Update a solicited IRB with CP information, and release the CP
     if the interrupt was the end of a START operation.
  2) Copy the IRB data into the io_region, under the protection of
     the io_mutex
  3) Reset the vfio-ccw FSM state to IDLE to acknowledge that
     vfio-ccw can accept more work.

The trouble is that step 3 is (A) invoked for both solicited and
unsolicited interrupts, and (B) sitting after the mutex for step 2.
This second piece becomes a problem if it processes an interrupt
for a CLEAR SUBCHANNEL while another thread initiates a START,
thus allowing the CP and FSM states to get out of sync. That is:

    CPU 1                           CPU 2
    fsm_do_clear()
    fsm_irq()
                                    fsm_io_request()
    vfio_ccw_sch_io_todo()
                                    fsm_io_helper()

Since the FSM state and CP should be kept in sync, let's make a
note when the CP is released, and rely on that as an indication
that the FSM should also be reset at the end of this routine and
open up the device for more work.
