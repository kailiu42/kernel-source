Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Fix mask extraction for bootloader
 programmed SMRs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

commit dead723e6f049e9fb6b05e5b93456982798ea961 upstream.

When extracting the mask for a SMR that was programmed by the
bootloader, the SMR's valid bit is also extracted and is treated
as part of the mask, which is not correct. Consider the scenario
where an SMMU master whose context is determined by a bootloader
programmed SMR is removed (omitting parts of device/driver core):

->iommu_release_device()
 -> arm_smmu_release_device()
  -> arm_smmu_master_free_smes()
   -> arm_smmu_free_sme() /* Assume that the SME is now free */
   -> arm_smmu_write_sme()
    -> arm_smmu_write_smr() /* Construct SMR value using mask and SID */

Since the valid bit was considered as part of the mask, the SMR will
be programmed as valid.

Fix the SMR mask extraction step for bootloader programmed SMRs
by masking out the valid bit when we know that we're already
working with a valid SMR.
