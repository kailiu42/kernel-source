Subject: [PATCH] spi: stm32-qspi: Always wait BUSY bit to be cleared in
 stm32_qspi_wait_cmd()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.13

[ Upstream commit d38fa9a155b2829b7e2cfcf8a4171b6dd3672808 ]

In U-boot side, an issue has been encountered when QSPI source clock is
running at low frequency (24 MHz for example), waiting for TCF bit to be
set didn't ensure that all data has been send out the FIFO, we should also
wait that BUSY bit is cleared.

To prevent similar issue in kernel driver, we implement similar behavior
by always waiting BUSY bit to be cleared.
