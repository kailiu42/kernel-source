Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q-dhcom: Add PU,VDD1P1,VDD2P5 regulators
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.10

commit 8967b27a6c1c19251989c7ab33c058d16e4a5f53 upstream.

Per schematic, both PU and SOC regulator are supplied from LTC3676 SW1
via VDDSOC_IN rail, add the PU input. Both VDD1P1, VDD2P5 are supplied
from LTC3676 SW2 via VDDHIGH_IN rail, add both inputs.

While no instability or problems are currently observed, the regulators
should be fully described in DT and that description should fully match
the hardware, else this might lead to unforseen issues later. Fix this.
