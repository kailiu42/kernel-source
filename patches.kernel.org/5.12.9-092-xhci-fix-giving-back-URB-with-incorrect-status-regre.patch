Subject: [PATCH] xhci: fix giving back URB with incorrect status regression in
 5.12
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

commit a80c203c3f1c06d2201c19ae071d0ae770a2b1ca upstream.

5.12 kernel changes how xhci handles cancelled URBs and halted
endpoints. Among these changes cancelled and stalled URBs are no longer
given back before they are cleared from xHC hardware cache.

These changes unfortunately cleared the -EPIPE status of a stalled
transfer in one case before giving bak the URB, causing a USB card reader
to fail from working.

Fixes: 674f8438c121 ("xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps")
