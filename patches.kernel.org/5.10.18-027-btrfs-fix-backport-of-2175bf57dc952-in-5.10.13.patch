Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix backport of 2175bf57dc952 in 5.10.13
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.18

There's a mistake in backport of upstream commit 2175bf57dc95 ("btrfs:
fix possible free space tree corruption with online conversion") as
5.10.13 commit 2175bf57dc95.

The enum value BTRFS_FS_FREE_SPACE_TREE_UNTRUSTED has been added to the
wrong enum set, colliding with value of BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE. This
could cause problems during the tree conversion, where the quotas
wouldn't be set up properly but the related code executed anyway due to
the bit set.
