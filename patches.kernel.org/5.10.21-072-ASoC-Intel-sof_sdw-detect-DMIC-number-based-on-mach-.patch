Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: detect DMIC number based on mach params
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.21

[ Upstream commit f88dcb9b98d3f86ead04d2453475267910448bb8 ]

Current driver create DMIC dai based on quirk for each platforms,
so we need to add quirk for new platforms. Now driver reports DMIC
number to machine driver and machine driver can create DMIC dai based
on this information. The old check is reserved for some platforms
may be failed to set the DMIC number in BIOS.
