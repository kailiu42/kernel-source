Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Clear configuration from channel context
 during reset
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

commit 47705c08465931923e2f2b506986ca0bdf80380d upstream.

When clearing up the channel context after client drivers are
done using channels, the configuration is currently not being
reset entirely. Ensure this is done to appropriately handle
issues where clients unaware of the context state end up calling
functions which expect a context.
