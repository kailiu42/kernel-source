Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Fix early setup to make early_ioremap() work
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.7

[ Upstream commit e2f5efd0f0e229bd110eab513e7c0331d61a4649 ]

The immediate problem is that after commit
0bd3f9e953bd ("powerpc/legacy_serial: Use early_ioremap()") the kernel
silently reboots on some systems.

The reason is that early_ioremap() returns broken addresses as it uses
slot_virt[] array which initialized with offsets from FIXADDR_TOP ==
IOREMAP_END+FIXADDR_SIZE == KERN_IO_END - FIXADDR_SIZ + FIXADDR_SIZE ==
__kernel_io_end which is 0 when early_ioremap_setup() is called.
__kernel_io_end is initialized little bit later in early_init_mmu().

This fixes the initialization by swapping early_ioremap_setup() and
early_init_mmu().

Fixes: 265c3491c4bc ("powerpc: Add support for GENERIC_EARLY_IOREMAP")
