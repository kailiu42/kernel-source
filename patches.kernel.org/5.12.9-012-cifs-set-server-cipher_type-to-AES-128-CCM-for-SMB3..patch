Subject: [PATCH] cifs: set server->cipher_type to AES-128-CCM for SMB3.0
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

commit 6d2fcfe6b517fe7cbf2687adfb0a16cdcd5d9243 upstream.

SMB3.0 doesn't have encryption negotiate context but simply uses
the SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flag.

When that flag is present in the neg response cifs.ko uses AES-128-CCM
which is the only cipher available in this context.

cipher_type was set to the server cipher only when parsing encryption
negotiate context (SMB3.1.1).

For SMB3.0 it was set to 0. This means cipher_type value can be 0 or 1
for AES-128-CCM.

Fix this by checking for SMB3.0 and encryption capability and setting
cipher_type appropriately.
