Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: mark Kingston SKC2000 as not supporting the deepest
 power state

commit dc22c1c058b5c4fe967a20589e36f029ee42a706 upstream

My 2TB SKC2000 showed the exact same symptoms that were provided
in 538e4a8c57 ("nvme-pci: avoid the deepest sleep state on
Kingston A2000 SSDs"), i.e. a complete NVME lockup that needed
cold boot to get it back.

According to some sources, the A2000 is simply a rebadged
SKC2000 with a slightly optimized firmware.

Adding the SKC2000 PCI ID to the quirk list with the same workaround
as the A2000 made my laptop survive a 5 hours long Yocto bootstrap
buildfest which reliably triggered the SSD lockup previously.
