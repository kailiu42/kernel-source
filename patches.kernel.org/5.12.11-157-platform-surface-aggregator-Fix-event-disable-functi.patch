Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Fix event disable function
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.11

commit b430e1d65ef6eeee42c4e53028f8dfcc6abc728b upstream.

Disabling events silently fails due to the wrong command ID being used.
Instead of the command ID for the disable call, the command ID for the
enable call was being used. This causes the disable call to enable the
event instead. As the event is already enabled when we call this
function, the EC silently drops this command and does nothing.

Use the correct command ID for disabling the event to fix this.
