Subject: [PATCH] cifs: detect dead connections only when echoes are enabled.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

commit f4916649f98e2c7bdba38c6597a98c456c17317d upstream.

We can detect server unresponsiveness only if echoes are enabled.
Echoes can be disabled under two scenarios:
1. The connection is low on credits, so we've disabled echoes/oplocks.
2. The connection has not seen any request till now (other than
negotiate/sess-setup), which is when we enable these two, based on
the credits available.

So this fix will check for dead connection, only when echo is enabled.
