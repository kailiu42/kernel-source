Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: renesas: beacon: Fix audio-1.8V pin enable
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 5a5da0b758b327b727c5392d7f11e046e113a195 ]

The fact the audio worked at all was a coincidence because the wrong
gpio enable was used.  Use the correct GPIO pin to ensure its operation.
