[ Upstream commit 8abe7fc26ad8f28bfdf78adbed56acd1fa93f82d ]

When cross-compiling with Clang, the `$(CLANG_FLAGS)' variable
contains additional flags needed to build C and assembly sources
for the target platform. Normally this variable is automatically
included in `$(KBUILD_CFLAGS)' via the top-level Makefile.

The x86 real-mode makefile builds `$(REALMODE_CFLAGS)' from a
plain assignment and therefore drops the Clang flags. This causes
Clang to not recognize x86-specific assembler directives:

  arch/x86/realmode/rm/header.S:36:1: error: unknown directive
  .type real_mode_header STT_OBJECT ; .size real_mode_header, .-real_mode_header
  ^

Explicit propagation of `$(CLANG_FLAGS)' to `$(REALMODE_CFLAGS)',
which is inherited by real-mode make rules, fixes cross-compilation
with Clang for x86 targets.

Relevant flags:

* `--target' sets the target architecture when cross-compiling. This
  flag must be set for both compilation and assembly (`KBUILD_AFLAGS')
  to support architecture-specific assembler directives.

* `-no-integrated-as' tells clang to assemble with GNU Assembler
  instead of its built-in LLVM assembler. This flag is set by default
  unless `LLVM_IAS=1' is set, because the LLVM assembler can't yet
  parse certain GNU extensions.
