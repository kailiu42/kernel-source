Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ALSA: gus: add a check of the status of snd_ctl_add"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

[ Upstream commit 1dacca7fa1ebea47d38d20cd2df37094805d2649 ]

This reverts commit 0f25e000cb4398081748e54f62a902098aa79ec1.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit did nothing if there was an error, except to print
out a message, which is pointless.  So remove the commit as it gives a
"false sense of doing something".
