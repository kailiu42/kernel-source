[ Upstream commit fab3a95654eea01d6b0204995be8b7492a00d001 ]

This new connection type is the new iteration of the Lightspeed
connection and will probably be used in some of the newer gaming
devices. It is currently use in the G Pro X Superlight.

This patch should be backported to older versions, as currently the
driver will panic when seing the unsupported connection. This isn't
an issue when using the receiver that came with the device, as Logitech
has been using different PIDs when they change the connection type, but
is an issue when using a generic receiver (well, generic Lightspeed
receiver), which is the case of the one in the Powerplay mat. Currently,
the only generic Ligthspeed receiver we support, and the only one that
exists AFAIK, is ther Powerplay.

As it stands, the driver will panic when seeing a G Pro X Superlight
connected to the Powerplay receiver and won't send any input events to
userspace! The kernel will warn about this so the issue should be easy
to identify, but it is still very worrying how hard it will fail :(
