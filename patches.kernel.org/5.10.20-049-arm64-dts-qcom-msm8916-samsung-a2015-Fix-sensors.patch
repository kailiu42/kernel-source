Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916-samsung-a2015: Fix sensors
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 3716a583fe0bbe3babf4ce260064a7fa13d6d989 ]

When the BMC150 accelerometer/magnetometer was added to the device tree,
the sensors were working without specifying any regulator supplies,
likely because the regulators were on by default and then never turned off.

For some reason, this is no longer the case for pm8916_l17, which prevents
the sensors from working in some cases.

Now that the bmc150_accel/bmc150_magn drivers can enable necessary
regulators, declare the necessary regulator supplies to make the sensors
work again.
