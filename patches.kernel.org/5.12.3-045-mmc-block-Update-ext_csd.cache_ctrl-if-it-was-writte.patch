Subject: [PATCH] mmc: block: Update ext_csd.cache_ctrl if it was written
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.3

commit aea0440ad023ab0662299326f941214b0d7480bd upstream.

The cache function can be turned ON and OFF by writing to the CACHE_CTRL
byte (EXT_CSD byte [33]).  However,  card->ext_csd.cache_ctrl is only
set on init if cache size > 0.

Fix that by explicitly setting ext_csd.cache_ctrl on ext-csd write.
