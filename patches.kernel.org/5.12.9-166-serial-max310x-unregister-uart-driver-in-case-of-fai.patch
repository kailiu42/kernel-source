Subject: [PATCH] serial: max310x: unregister uart driver in case of failure
 and abort
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.9

[ Upstream commit 3890e3dea315f1a257d1b940a2a4e2fa16a7b095 ]

The macro "spi_register_driver" invokes the function
"__spi_register_driver()" which has a return type of int and can fail,
returning a negative value in such a case. This is currently ignored and
the init() function yields success even if the spi driver failed to
register.

Fix this by collecting the return value of "__spi_register_driver()" and
also unregister the uart driver in case of failure.
