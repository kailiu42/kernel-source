Subject: [PATCH] mm/mmu_notifiers: ensure range_end() is paired with

[ Upstream commit c2655835fd8cabdfe7dab737253de3ffb88da126 ]

If one or more notifiers fails .invalidate_range_start(), invoke
.invalidate_range_end() for "all" notifiers.  If there are multiple
notifiers, those that did not fail are expecting _start() and _end() to
be paired, e.g.  KVM's mmu_notifier_count would become imbalanced.
Disallow notifiers that can fail _start() from implementing _end() so
that it's unnecessary to either track which notifiers rejected _start(),
or had already succeeded prior to a failed _start().

Note, the existing behavior of calling _start() on all notifiers even
after a previous notifier failed _start() was an unintented "feature".
Make it canon now that the behavior is depended on for correctness.

As of today, the bug is likely benign:

  1. The only caller of the non-blocking notifier is OOM kill.
  2. The only notifiers that can fail _start() are the i915 and Nouveau
     drivers.
  3. The only notifiers that utilize _end() are the SGI UV GRU driver
     and KVM.
  4. The GRU driver will never coincide with the i195/Nouveau drivers.
  5. An imbalanced kvm->mmu_notifier_count only causes soft lockup in the
     _guest_, and the guest is already doomed due to being an OOM victim.

Fix the bug now to play nice with future usage, e.g.  KVM has a
potential use case for blocking memslot updates in KVM while an
invalidation is in-progress, and failure to unblock would result in said
updates being blocked indefinitely and hanging.

Found by inspection.  Verified by adding a second notifier in KVM that
periodically returns -EAGAIN on non-blockable ranges, triggering OOM,
and observing that KVM exits with an elevated notifier count.
