Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: core: Fix erase type discovery for overlaid
 region
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

commit 969b276718de37dfe66fce3a5633f611e8cd58fd upstream.

In case of overlaid regions in which their biggest erase size command
overpasses in size the region's size, only the non-overlaid portion of
the sector gets erased. For example, if a Sector Erase command is applied
to a 256-kB range that is overlaid by 4-kB sectors, the overlaid 4-kB
sectors are not affected by the erase.
For overlaid regions, 'region->size' is assigned to 'cmd->size' later in
spi_nor_init_erase_cmd(), so 'erase->size' can be greater than 'len'.
