Subject: [PATCH] sctp: fix a SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB leak in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.12.5

[ Upstream commit f282df0391267fb2b263da1cc3233aa6fb81defc ]

Normally SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB is always incremented once asoc enter into
ESTABLISHED from the state < ESTABLISHED and decremented when the asoc
is being deleted.

However, in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b(), the asoc's state can be changed to
ESTABLISHED from the state >= ESTABLISHED where it shouldn't increment
SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB. Otherwise, one asoc may increment MIB_CURRESTAB
multiple times but only decrement once at the end.

I was able to reproduce it by using scapy to do the 4-way shakehands,
after that I replayed the COOKIE-ECHO chunk with 'peer_vtag' field
changed to different values, and SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB was incremented
multiple times and never went back to 0 even when the asoc was freed.

This patch is to fix it by only incrementing SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB when
the state < ESTABLISHED in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b().
