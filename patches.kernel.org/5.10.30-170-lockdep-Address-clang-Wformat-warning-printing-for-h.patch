Subject: [PATCH] lockdep: Address clang -Wformat warning printing for %hd
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.30

commit 6d48b7912cc72275dc7c59ff961c8bac7ef66a92 upstream.

Clang doesn't like format strings that truncate a 32-bit
value to something shorter:

  kernel/locking/lockdep.c:709:4: error: format specifies type 'short' but the argument has type 'int' [-Werror,-Wformat]

In this case, the warning is a slightly questionable, as it could realize
that both class->wait_type_outer and class->wait_type_inner are in fact
8-bit struct members, even though the result of the ?: operator becomes an
'int'.

However, there is really no point in printing the number as a 16-bit
'short' rather than either an 8-bit or 32-bit number, so just change
it to a normal %d.
