Subject: [PATCH] init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !S390
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.29

commit 334ef6ed06fa1a54e35296b77b693bcf6d63ee9e upstream.

While allmodconfig and allyesconfig build for s390 there are also
various bots running compile tests with randconfig, where PCI is
disabled. This reveals that a lot of drivers should actually depend on
HAS_IOMEM.
Adding this to each device driver would be a never ending story,
therefore just disable COMPILE_TEST for s390.

The reasoning is more or less the same as described in
commit bc083a64b6c0 ("init/Kconfig: make COMPILE_TEST depend on !UML").
