Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Compare __SYNC_loongson3_war against 0
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: v5.10.20

[ Upstream commit 8790ccf8daf1a8c53b6cb8ce0c9a109274bd3fa8 ]

When building with clang when CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON3_WORKAROUNDS is
enabled:

                                    ^

While it is not wrong that the result of this shift is always true in a
boolean context, it is not a problem here. Regardless, the warning is
really noisy so rather than making the shift a boolean implicitly, use
it in an equality comparison so the shift is used as an integer value.

Fixes: a91f2a1dba44 ("MIPS: cmpxchg: Omit redundant barriers for Loongson3")
